This script was create by Leonid Tanas and Mihaela Tanas in order to speed up the process of visualizing and evaluating data generated by ggdc_3.0 (https://ggdc.dsmz.de/ggdc.php#). It basically takes .xls files generated by ggdc_3.0 and organize the dDDH values in a matrix that can be visualized directly with Heatmapper at http://www.heatmapper.ca/. 
Input consists of a single .xls file (DDH comparison with all plasmids.xlsx) containing multiple sheets, one sheet per strain/plasmid, each sheet labeled with the GenBank ID of the given strain/plasmid. The script parses the column with the dDDH values in all sheets and outputs a table (output.xlsx) with a pairwise comparation matrix of all the strains/plasmids. 
The script was developed and used for the Bachelor thesis of Mihaela Tanas,  Comparative analysis of 61 plasmids related to pAO1, Biology Department, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania, 2024.
